"Every year at some location on the planet there are natural disasters such as earthquakes, mudslides, floods, volcano eruptions, tsnamis, forest fires, and man-made disasters emanating from terrorism, wars or local tribal fighting. There is one constant result: people die from exposure to the elements, from direct personal violence, from the loss of their homes to quick flowing water or mud or falling buildings. Finding shelter in a rainy environment, at night, is extremely difficult.  Living exposed to weather conditions, particularly when the temperature falls below 50 degrees F., especially for a family, is beyond stressful.

The consuming nations of the world, especially when there are no local natural disasters requiring nearly constant attention, accumulate an abundance of plastic materials including water bottles, containers, toys, part-plastic partitions,  which those same nations have developed recycling facilities that turn varying plastic materials into other more useable plastic material. Certainly one of the easiest products to make is called the Meal-Brick(TM R).

A Meal-Brick(TM,R) is a recycled, clear, or colored walled, FOLDABLE, EXPANDABLE, iNTERLOCKING, CUBE OR SQUARE  or  Rectangular PLASTIC CONTAINER of various sized walls, sides, top and bottom where 'Living Hinges' from the same or similar plastic are strategically placed to permit the cube to FOLD in-ward/outward/downward/upward so that in expanded state it might measure 12"""" X 12"""" X 12"""" or any fraction thereof and which can be stacked together and banded with PVC wrapping either as expanded cubes or, alternatively, can be folded down so that the sides and tops of each cube touch themselves and where one cube may touch other similar cubes in a larger pallet sized square so that, even 1500 similar squares, that, will float can be air-dropped so that two such pallets, together with 'tarps' as roofs, could be stacked one atop of another and which are not only designed to interlock via plastic-tits together but with each set in a manner that stakes of wood or iron shaped and reshaped from local detritus caused from former, now fallen, structures and so locked but such detritus as to make sturdy walls, including openings for windows and doors (also from detritus) sufficient to house a family of at least 12 people.

Meal-Brick can arrive full folded to thus serve as components of construction (with a house-shelter capable of being assembled/erected within 4 hours thus providing overall shelter in a 24 hour period for 72 people. The cost of each PLASTIC BRICK, manufactured in factories by 100,000 per day shall be supplemented by the World Bank and Contributing Countries @ 1 US Dollar/Brick. The Bricks may also be delivered with folding internal compartments and rigidity structures already full of bottles of water, packets of crackers, Meal-Ready-to-Eat, Basic Medicines, Water Purifying tablets, and anything else that could be packed into the 12"""" x 12""""x12"""" (or smaller cubic, rectangular, square) container interior space.

Air-Dropping onto grass-lands, hedge-groves, near shores of streams and rivers, or ocean shores permits rapid deployment and delivery of required food-stuffs and medicines, and shelters at minimum costs especially since it is anticipated that pre-positioning of these supplies could be arranged in areas threatened by disaster,  terrorism, and conflict. 

Images of Meal-Brick both in a Foldable and in a Filled state are attached.

While Meal-Brick offers a near permanent shelter since the assembled houses, once built will sustain weathering for as long as 5 years.
 A less permanent shelter, call SLEEP-SAFE (PAT. PEND.) IS also included.  Sleep-safe, Is a protective covering made from Kevlar-like anti-ballistic cloth with strategic pockets place on its perimeter and side that will hold further anti-ballistic, plastic, wood, and metal plates designed and positioned to prevent shrapnel  and the detritus from nearby explosions NOT to Penetrate. Further Sleep-Safe is set up on Plasticized/Metal Rigging so as to achieve an assembled shape of the Abrams Battle Tank Turret so as to further retard projectiles and shrapnel.  Sleep-Safe may also be hung along walls or openings to provide further protection with each such Sleep-Safe covering measuring 6' x 8'.  With the use of heavy zippers, Sleep-Safe may be re-configured into a ground covering such as the covering over a Fox-Hole. Further, the cover may be reconfigured using the Zippers as a PERSONNEL PONCHO so that individual Sleep-Safe covers become wearable individual protection for soldiers or combattants.

"The Loop system is designed to address the growing problem of single-use packaging waste. In today's linear economy, many consumer products are packaged in single-use containers that are used once and then discarded. This creates a significant amount of waste that ends up in landfills or oceans, contributing to environmental problems such as pollution and climate change. Furthermore, the current waste management system is often unable to handle the volume of waste generated, resulting in overflowing landfills and environmental degradation.

The Loop system offers a solution to this problem by creating a closed-loop system that reduces waste and promotes sustainability. By using durable, reusable containers that can be refilled and delivered directly to consumers, the system eliminates the need for single-use packaging and reduces the amount of waste that ends up in landfills or oceans. The Loop system also promotes sustainable consumption patterns by making it more convenient for consumers to reduce their waste and make more environmentally conscious choices.

"The problem that this idea is meant to address is the large amount of waste generated in the construction industry. In particular, the construction process generates a significant amount of waste from building materials, tools, and equipment. This waste contributes to landfills, pollution, and resource depletion. Additionally, traditional construction practices often result in buildings and structures that are designed for a single use and have a limited lifespan, leading to the frequent demolition and replacement of buildings. This results in the loss of valuable resources, including materials, energy, and labor.

The idea is to promote the use of modular building components that can be reused and repurposed in different construction projects, reducing waste and conserving resources. By using modular components that can be easily disassembled, transported, and reassembled, builders and developers can reduce the amount of waste generated in the construction process, while still producing high-quality, durable buildings. This approach can also help to create a more circular construction industry, where waste is reduced and resources are conserved."

The first solution that needs to be adopted is a permanent pricing system. This system would have to determine the optimal pricing to keep prices stable in the market. Prices also need to be adjusted year-round, i.e. if the price has been pushed high, the leader needs to be able to readjust the price to keep it stable.

In addition, leaders should also create a stable legal system to limit the imperfect transformation of the market. This legal system will help to strengthen the protection of the interests of all market participants and also help prevent adverse events and possibilities. This legal system will also help ensure that suppliers have to provide goods and items to buyers at a reasonable price."

The information of waste worldwide for a better circular economy.
This solution aims to minimize the waste that is produced by human hand nails.
"The circular economy is a solution to the problem of waste and resource depletion in the traditional linear economy, where resources are extracted, used, and then disposed of as waste. This model is unsustainable in the long term, as it leads to the depletion of finite resources, contributes to environmental degradation, and creates waste that accumulates in landfills and oceans.

The circular economy aims to keep resources in use for as long as possible, by designing waste out of the system and minimizing the use of virgin materials. It seeks to create a closed-loop system where waste is seen as a resource, and products and materials are continuously reused, refurbished, and recycled.

The implementation of circular economy principles can provide a range of benefits, including:

Increased resource efficiency: The circular economy minimizes the use of finite resources, such as fossil fuels and metals, by keeping materials in use for as long as possible.

Reduced waste: By designing waste out of the system, the circular economy reduces the amount of waste generated, and minimizes the negative impact of waste on the environment.

Increased economic competitiveness: The circular economy provides opportunities for new business models and technologies, and can lead to cost savings through increased resource efficiency and reduced waste.

Improved environmental sustainability: The circular economy minimizes the use of finite resources and reduces the negative impact of waste, contributing to a more sustainable future.

Overall, the circular economy is a solution to the problem of waste and resource depletion in the traditional linear economy.

"Due to the rising cooling demand in recent decades, conventional air conditioning systems are used to fulfil this demand. These systems use hydro chlorofluorocarbons as refrigerants, leading to global warming due to CO2 emission and consuming more electricity. Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems consume more than 40% of the entire buildingÕs energy. However, evaporative coolers are environment-friendly and the least energy-consumptive option for buildings. But in the monsoon season, humidity increases, and these coolers and conventional AC do not control humidity and cause dankness. Humid air enters the room and crosses the thermal comfort, which is why these do not ensure thermal comfort. Therefore, maintaining thermal comfort in an environment-friendly and energy-efficient manner under hot and humid conditions is a major problem. Air dehumidification is done by using desiccant material in a dehumidifier or desiccant wheel, but these are more costly. At the same time, low-capacity cooler up to 250 CFM for industrial applications is available in the market. There is a need to have high-capacity evaporative coolers up to 1000 to 1500 CFM.

The aim is to design a high-capacity dew point indirect evaporative cooler (dew point-IEC) using efficient materials, geometries, and working airflow patterns along with a desiccant-based air dehumidification system.

"With every product, ranging from common groceries to savory foods and even health care products, there is a package. Modern packages of the aforementioned are made of plastic, paper, and other materials that have been found to be environmentally unfriendly. Plastic, for instance, is a material that takes a considerable amount of time to degrade when sent to landfills. Even after degrading for 400 to 1000 years, the contents are not really of much use to the soil. More plastic is being produced, and when it is not recycled, it adds to landfill waste. As a matter of fact, this cycle repeats itself, and our planet is at stake. 
What if there was an organic packaging method that would not contribute a single piece of plastic, paper, or rubber to landfills? That would mean a complete circular economy that alleviates pollution and is more efficient to our environment."

"The circular economy is a solution to address the unsustainable linear economic model that has dominated our economy for decades. The linear model follows a take-make-dispose approach where raw materials are extracted, transformed into products, and then discarded as waste at the end of their life. This model results in resource depletion, pollution, and waste accumulation, leading to environmental degradation and social issues.

The apparel and textiles industry, in particular, faces various challenges due to the linear economic model. The industry is known for its high resource consumption, waste generation, and social issues, such as labor exploitation and poor working conditions. The fast fashion business model, where clothes are produced quickly and inexpensively and often discarded after just a few wears, has contributed to the industry's environmental and social issues.

The circular economy model aims to address these challenges by promoting sustainable practices, reducing waste, and increasing resource efficiency. By keeping materials in use for as long as possible, the circular economy model aims to reduce the pressure on natural resources, minimize waste and pollution, and promote regenerative practices.

By implementing circular economy principles, the apparel and textiles industry can reduce its environmental impact, create more sustainable business models, and improve working conditions and social issues.

"I live in Berlin and am an enthusiastic carsharing user. In the EU, car sharing is considered a classic example of the Circular Economy (""""Circular Green"""") and undeniably has many advantages but also serious disadvantages. One disadvantage is the search for a parking space, which in Berlin is strongly dependent on the respective district. The further you drive into the city, the more difficult it is to find a parking space. One problem is that the rental process can only be completed once the vehicle has been appropriately parked. Only then can someone take over the car and start their journey. This sometimes leads to significantly extended driving distances because the parking spaces can sometimes be very far away, or you must drive around the block many times. This increases not only the costs but also the fuel consumption and the frustration level because this problem could deter especially occasional users."

"One of the major problems faced by businesses today is the high accumulation of electronic waste, often referred to as e-waste. Rapid technological advancements and the constant need for upgrades have led to a surge in the generation of e-waste. This results not only in significant environmental degradation due to improper disposal methods but also in a loss of valuable materials like precious metals that are a part of these discarded units.  The problem is not limited to end-of-life electronics but extends to units that require repair or parts replacement as well. Companies often find it more cost-effective to manufacture new products than repairing old ones, thereby exacerbating the e-waste problem. Also, the cost of recovering valuable materials from e-waste is often high, leading to a tendency to overlook recycling practices.  This constant supply-demand cycle for new electronics creates a linear economy that is highly unsustainable. It puts immense pressure on the planet's resources while failing to add enough value to businesses in the long run.

"Electric Arc Furnace technology has become a very common technique in the steelmaking industry over the last four decades. According to the World Steel Association, global crude steel production reached 1951.2 million tons in 2021. The electric arc furnace route represents about 28.9% in 2021 of the worldÕs steel production. As the use of this technology has increased, significant pollutants such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, and solid particles have been released into the atmosphere during the steelmaking process using the Electric Arc Furnace method. Electric arc furnace dust (EAFD) is a solid waste produced by an electric arc furnace during the steelmaking process. Electric-arc furnace technology produces a significant amount of dust during steel production, estimated to be 15-20 kg per tonne of the total steel produced. Because it contains heavy metals such as iron, copper, zinc, Cobalt, Cadmium, or Lead, it has been classified as a hazardous material and non-disposable in the environment by the European Waste Catalogue (EWC), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Brazilian National Standards Organization (ABNT). The Disposal of EAFD in landfills represented an environmental hazard due to its dusty nature and the presence of potentially toxic metals and the cost of disposal is not negligible in the United States, for example, it costs 200 million dollars per year to dispose of EAFD."

As technology continues to advance rapidly, the lifespan of these devices decreases, creating a significant environmental problem. According to the Global E-waste Monitor, only about 20% of e-waste is recycled globally. Furthermore, this e-waste represents a significant loss of resources, as it often contains valuable metals which are discarded.   "
"By recycling, reusing, repairing, and refurbishing, we are focusing more than ever on the circular economy in today's society. Through a circular economy, we have a better chance of reaching sustainability by not affecting our environment and reducing waste. But what about space? While we have started looking for ways to reduce our waste and footprint on Earth, we have forgotten the junk that we have deposited in EarthÕs orbit and our atmosphere.
 
Imagine trying to take a walk outside your house but then you encounter your sidewalk completely littered. There is garbage piled up in mountains, just overflowing everywhere around you. All you can do is hobble your way around this mess, jumping from one end of the sidewalk to the other, just hoping that this disaster is all a dream. This is a similar problem that we have in space, and an accurate summary of debris in space is known as """"space junk.""""
 
Space junk is debris or satellites left by humans in space. Space debris is extremely dangerous and can cause significant damage to spacecraft or other satellites. These pieces of metal debris in low-Earth orbit travel at about 20 times the speed of sound, or about 25,265 kmh. These particles have the capacity to create an impact force that can easily rupture the wall of a spacecraft, rendering a well-built spacecraft or satellite useless upon impact. Imagine that instead of these small particles, there are thousands of """"dead"""" satellites orbiting Earth that not only take up space but are also actively causing damage to other satellites. Space junk has also been classified by scientists as contributing to """"light pollution,"""" but more importantly, it deposits hazardous and toxic waste chemicals in EarthÕs atmosphere as debris burns up upon re-entry; these compositional chemicals have also been known to deplete EarthÕs ozone layer. It has been estimated by researchers that approximately 80 tonnes of space junk enters the EarthÕs atmosphere and burns up. Most of the chemicals produced as a result of this are compositional metals and polymers, and these chemical reactions produce nitric oxide. These compositional metals, polymers, and nitric oxide are known to deplete ozone from the atmosphere, having an impact on climate change.
 
There are approximately 2000 active satellites, while on the other hand, there are more than 39,000 pieces of space junk, including """"dead"""" and non-operational satellites. Additionally, there are more than 128 million pieces of small space junk orbiting Earth. There is more than 5,500 tonnes of space junk, and if materials from """"dead"""" satellites or space junk can be harvested, it would save billions of dollars from mining new metals. Additionally, equipment from space debris could also be reused or even repaired and sent back to space instead of creating an entirely new satellite from scratch only to replace another. Not only that, but space junk also poses a huge risk for future space exploration. Space exploration is our future, and with all the space junk, our future in space looks bleak.
 
If this problem of space junk is not solved, Kessler Syndrome could very well start to be a real thing. As Donald Kessler, a NASA scientist, proposed in 1978, we could encounter a scary scenario where we could overpopulate EarthÕs orbit with objects and debris to the extent that we wonÕt be able to launch satellites into certain parts of EarthÕs orbit. Not only that, but Kessler also said that as a result of this overpopulation of space debris, it will result in a high rate of collisions between satellites and debris, which not only damage active satellites but each collision will result in more debris being created that will take part in more collisions; increasing the rate of collision and damage at an exponential rate. This disaster, predicted over 4 decades ago, seems to be a reality we are only getting closer to."

"Designing products for durability and recyclability is a key component of a circular economy. This involves creating products that are made to last and can be easily disassembled and recycled at the end of their life cycle. Here are some steps that can be taken to design products for durability and recyclability:

Use durable and high-quality materials: Designers should choose materials that are long-lasting and can withstand wear and tear. This will increase the lifespan of the product and reduce the need for frequent replacements.

Consider the product life cycle: Designers should consider the entire life cycle of the product, from production to disposal. They should choose materials and manufacturing processes that have minimal environmental impact and design products that can be easily disassembled and recycled at the end of their life.

Design for easy repair: Products should be designed with repair in mind, so that if a component fails, it can be easily replaced. This will extend the life of the product and reduce the need for new products.

Use standard components: Standard components make it easier to repair and replace parts, reducing the need for custom parts and simplifying the recycling process.

Consider end-of-life options: Designers should consider what will happen to the product at the end of its life. They should design products that can be easily disassembled and recycled or repurposed.

Overall, designing products for durability and recyclability can help reduce waste and pollution, conserve natural resources, and create a more sustainable economy."

"The problem that this solution is meant to solve is the growing issue of plastic pollution. Plastic waste has become a major environmental problem, with millions of tons of plastic entering the oceans each year and harming marine life. Traditional plastics and polythene are non-biodegradable and can take hundreds of years to decompose, leading to a buildup of waste in landfills and natural environments.

The production and disposal of traditional plastics and polythene also contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, which exacerbate climate change. The manufacturing process for these materials involves the extraction and processing of fossil fuels, which emit greenhouse gases, and the disposal of plastic waste in landfills, which also releases methane, a potent greenhouse gas.

Therefore, the use of bamboo as a material for packaging and as a substitute for traditional plastics and polythene is a sustainable and eco-friendly solution to this problem. Bamboo is a renewable resource that can be sustainably harvested and cultivated without the need for harmful chemicals or fertilizers. Additionally, bamboo-based products are biodegradable and compostable, making them a sustainable alternative to traditional plastics and polythene.
